<h1> Bobbys DIY Degree </h1>
<p>
During the next 12 months I'm embarking on a challenge to prove that university level education can be achieved for free by self learning and life experiences. I beleive that anyone can choose for themselves to learn new skills, and take massive steps towards living a more fulfilling life. You don't need permission from any institution and you don't need to spend tens of thousands of pounds.

I never studied at university and for a long time felt as though this had left a lot of doors closed for me. I kept seeing things that I couldn't do, and felt stuck in a sales career that was never something I'd aspired to. But I look around now and I see a whole world in which the role of the gatekeeper is diminishing; authors can self publish, photographers can reach their audience directly on Instagram. It's a trend that won't be stopped, we're in a time now where people can choose for themselves, you can reach your audience or customers directly, you don't need the galleries permission to get your artwork displayed.

So what does this mean? I'm going to spend the next 12 months acquiring new skills and experiences that I believe will have a bigger impact in improving my quality of life and in 'opening doors' than any university degree in the world could provide. I'm also going to do it whilst maintaining a positive cashflow, I'll actually have more money at the end of the year than I started with, as opposed to the excessive debts associated with higher education in the UK.
